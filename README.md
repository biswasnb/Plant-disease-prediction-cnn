# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN ðŸŒ¿

This deep learning project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify and predict plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains over 50,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves across multiple plant species.
